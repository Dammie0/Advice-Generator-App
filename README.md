### What I learned
I learnt how to use the hover element in css and the box shadow. Here's a snippet on what i learnt

.advice-btn:hover{
    box-shadow: rgba(82,255,169,0.466) 0px 8px 24px, 
                rgba(82,255,169,0.411) 0px 16px 56px, 
                rgba(82,255,169,0.479) 0px 24px 80px ;
}
